Becoming More Agile

Continue to work for Turners Car Auctions as an IT Professional.  Continuing with the project to re-design the motor vehicle insurance purchasing experience.The team will adopt some Agile practices.  

Task 1. Prototype to Showcase AI Solution
Build an application to find Similar Cars

The digital team at Turners would like to prototype a solution that allows a user to upload the picture of a car, and then find a similar car in their stock to recommend to customer. Build an application (either runs on your laptop or on the cloud) that can recognise motor vehicles (even better if it recognises certain types of vehicles, e.g. sedan vs hatchback) using a cloud-based AI service on Microsoft Azure (or AWS or Google Cloud). You can copy code from tutorials you find online, but make sure you read through the code so that you understand the code. 

Task 2. Code Review
Obtain feedback on your code from your team member by allowing them to review your code.
